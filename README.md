# Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person is an **introvert** or **extrovert** based on their personality traits and characteristics. It was built as part of a technical assessment using a provided dataset.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a set of features describing a person's personality traits, the goal is to classify them into one of two categories:
- **Introvert**
- **Extrovert**

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning algorithms were explored:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting (optional)

Performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics.
